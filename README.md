# 8079-GPS-Sensor-Testing
gps sensor code for VRC team 8079. mostly just prints out information on the brain screen, driving code is still a WIP

hi so i don't know how to use github 
i put all my GPS sensor code for testing in here so my teammates can look at it and know what the heck i am doing
i'll occasionally just shove files into here and the easier to see code file just make it easier to see 
the easier to see code is just so you can see what my code actually is
